# Layout and Sidebar Fix Instructions
##############################################################

The Layout and Sidebar Fix Script has been applied to fix issues with
the sidebar toggle, layout, and cost configuration. The following
changes were made:

1. Added enhanced layout CSS for improved responsiveness
2. Added enhanced sidebar CSS for better styling and interaction
3. Fixed sidebar-manager.js to properly handle sidebar toggle
4. Added cost-config-fix.js to ensure cost configuration works
5. Updated index.html to include new CSS and JS files

To verify that the fixes work properly:

1. Refresh your browser after applying these changes
2. Open the browser console (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I)
3. Look for any error messages related to the sidebar or layout
4. Try clicking the sidebar toggle button to collapse/expand the sidebar
5. Try clicking on the cost configuration header to collapse/expand it
6. Check that the range sliders in the cost configuration update properly
7. Run the test script by adding this to your browser console:
   ```
   var script = document.createElement('script');
   script.src = 'check-layout-sidebar.js';
   document.body.appendChild(script);
   ```

If you're still experiencing issues, please check:
- That all the files were created in the correct locations
- That there are no JavaScript errors in the console
- That all necessary CSS and JS files are properly linked in index.html
