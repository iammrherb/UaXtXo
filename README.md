# Portnox Total Cost Analyzer - Critical Fixes

This package addresses critical issues with the Portnox Total Cost Analyzer:

1. Duplicate vendor cards
2. Layout and wizard overlap issues
3. 404 errors for JavaScript files
4. Selection and navigation problems

## Quick Fix Instructions

### Option 1: Run the fix script

```bash
./portnox-tca-critical-fix.sh
```

This creates all necessary files to fix the application.

### Option 2: Apply fixes directly in browser

1. Open the developer console in your browser (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I)
2. Copy the contents of the `browser-fix.js` file
3. Paste it into the console and press Enter

This will immediately fix the issues without requiring file uploads.

## Details of Fixes

### 1. Duplicate Vendor Cards

The script removes duplicate vendor cards and ensures proper selection handling.

### 2. Layout Issues

CSS fixes are applied to ensure proper wizard layout and prevent overlapping sections.

### 3. Missing JavaScript Files

The script creates the missing files that were causing 404 errors:
- risk-analyzer.js
- industry-compliance.js
- custom-tco-implementation.js

### 4. Navigation Problems

The script fixes navigation buttons and ensures proper event handling.

## Testing

After applying fixes, you should be able to:

1. See all vendor cards without duplicates
2. Select a vendor card (it will highlight)
3. See the selected vendor preview
4. Click the Next button to proceed to the next step

If issues persist, try running the browser-fix.js script directly in the console.
