The average healthcare data breach costs $10.9M, making robust NAC essential. Key trends include telehealth expansion, IoMT growth, and increasing ransomware targeting. Portnox CLEAR addresses these challenges with specialized healthcare compliance templates, medical device profiling, and zero-downtime cloud architecture.`,
    
    financial: `Financial services require NAC solutions meeting PCI DSS, SOX, and GLBA requirements while supporting real-time transaction processing. With average breach costs of $5.9M and increasing regulatory scrutiny, automated compliance and fraud prevention capabilities are critical. Digital banking transformation and fintech partnerships are driving cloud-native NAC adoption. Portnox CLEAR provides comprehensive financial compliance automation and real-time threat detection.`,
    
    government: `Government agencies need NAC solutions meeting FedRAMP, FISMA, and CMMC requirements while protecting classified information. Zero Trust mandates and cloud-first policies are reshaping security architectures. Supply chain security and cyber warfare threats require advanced capabilities. Portnox CLEAR offers FedRAMP-ready deployment with comprehensive government compliance templates.`,
