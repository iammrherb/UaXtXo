# Security View Fix Instructions
##############################################################

The Security View Fix Script has been applied to fix the issue with the
Security View not initializing properly. The following changes were made:

1. Added/fixed the Security View panel in index.html
2. Added/updated the security-view.js file with proper initialization logic
3. Added/updated security-view.css for enhanced styling
4. Ensured all necessary files are linked in index.html
5. Created a test script to verify initialization

To verify that the Security View now works properly:

1. Refresh your browser after applying these changes
2. Open the browser console (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I)
3. Look for any error messages related to the Security View
4. Try clicking on the "Security & Compliance" tab to see if it displays correctly
5. Run the test script by adding this to your browser console:
   ```
   var script = document.createElement('script');
   script.src = 'check-security-view.js';
   document.body.appendChild(script);
   ```

If you're still experiencing issues, please check:
- That all the files were created in the correct locations
- That there are no JavaScript errors in the console
- That all necessary CSS and JS files are properly linked in index.html
