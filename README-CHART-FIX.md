# Chart Fix for Zero Trust Total Cost Analyzer

This fix addresses the chart initialization issues in the Total Cost Analyzer application.

## Issues Fixed

- Canvas element not found errors
- Chart initialization timing issues
- Charts not appearing when switching tabs
- Improper chart updates and refreshes

## Implementation Details

The fix implements a robust chart initialization system that:

1. Checks for canvas element existence before initialization
2. Lazily loads charts based on tab visibility
3. Properly reinitializes charts when tabs become visible
4. Provides a clean API for chart manipulation

## Usage

The fix exposes a global `chartBuilder` object with the following methods:

- `chartBuilder.initialize()` - Initialize all visible charts
- `chartBuilder.initChart(chartId)` - Initialize a specific chart
- `chartBuilder.updateChart(chartId, newData)` - Update chart data
- `chartBuilder.getChartInstance(chartId)` - Get chart instance

## Verification

Run the `verify-chart-fix.js` script in your browser console to verify the fix is working correctly.

## Important Notes

- This fix is compatible with the existing charts.js implementation
- No changes to data structures or chart configurations were needed
- The fix gracefully handles missing elements without errors
